                    <p>This is my first ever attempt to make a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. The goal of the website is to introduce the video that my group had filmed.  </p>
                    <p>Our video has a funny, simple, and improvising style so I aimed to make a website that also have those characteristic. I want my website&#39;s visiters to have an entertaining experience with both the website and the video. Included with the funny music in the video, I chose bright and funky color for the inteface. For the font, I chose the clean and simple one. Moreover, I took advantages of boomerang clips in my website. Boomerang clips are also represent for funkiness as it usually marketed via Instagram. </p>
                    <h2 id="difficulties-">Difficulties:</h2>
                    <p>In the process of making the website, of course I encountered various difficulties. Up till now, there are still enhancing ideas that I have not finished yet. However, I am very satisfied with my result as I could not believe that I managed to created a website. This first assignment is a good start off for me to familiarized with designing on a digital screen size canvas. I believe that so far with this experience, I be able to do even better in the upcoming projects. </p>

                <p>In this assignment, our team (Ishmal, Loan, Matthew, and Michael) is telling a story through our interactive comic website. </p>
                <p>We have our comic named as &quot;Last Moments&quot; narrating events in one day before our main protagonist dies in a car accident. We want to express the unexpectedness of deaths through our story. </p>
                <h2 id="responsiblity-">Responsiblity:</h2>
                <p>My responsibility for this project is leanning more on the artistic and building story side than on the technical web development. </p>
                <p>I am responsible for the sript writing, framing the panels, color/images choosing, and media managing. More specifically, I am also in charged of finding the stock images, ambience sounds, and making the intro video. </p>
                <h2 id="difficulties-">Difficulties:</h2>
                <p>In this project, the main difficulty that I encounter is conflicting in ideas due to different perspective about arts. We had disagreement on the font choosing, the size/ length of the video, the plot of the story, et cetera. Fortunately, we managed to compromise things to reach a futher goals of finishing our project. </p>

                    <h2 id="concept-">Concept:</h2>
                    <p>In the third assigment, me and my teammate - Hasin -  decided to create a sound experience on the website for the users. It is a journey to Pakistan and Vietnam through the countries&#39; cultural music. </p>
                    <p>We created a plot by having our conversation as two friends who are interested in learning more about each other&#39;s culture. The plot is the glue to attach two different countries and two different culture. </p>
                    <p>The users of the website are first introduced to the context of the story with the conversation between to characters. After the conversation, the users will then be guided to the two countries. There, they will have the liberty to choose which music from which region of the country to experience. After choosing, the users will hear music and narration for that regional music. At the end of the journey, we concluded the story with an opening ending. The opening ending is implemented by giving the option to the users to suggest the destination that they want to have the same experience with in the future. The option is the suggesting box that the users can send opinions to the web developers. </p>
                    <p>Our main focus on this assignment is the sound; therefore, we agreed in not using words or any description to explain. Instead, we use narration and everything was kept minimal so that the user will not be distracted with the visual. </p>

                    <p>In this assignment, my team (Loan - Fatima - Shamma - Rashid) decided to create a website, a company, and an advertisement video to promote our &quot;product&quot;: THE BOX.</p>
                    <p>Although the requirment of this assignment is creating a website and a video, our team made a further step in order to create the most realistic scenario as possible by prototyping the box, having photoshoots for the box, et cetera.  </p>
                    <p>&quot;THE BOX&quot; is introduced as a more friendly &quot;Alexa&quot; intergrated with the newest AI technology. Other than normal task that a virtual assistant can do, this product is a friend that can give the users advices, comforts, and responsive feedbacks about feelings. All of these characteristics were portrayed to the customers through our video. </p>
                    <p>Our product can speak 3 languages: English, Arabic, and French. We did not catergorize THE BOX&#39;s gender but instead, we just named two version of of THE BOX: Levon and Eiry. In term of THE BOX&#39;s voice, we ask two of our friends (Michael and Budoor) to do the voice over in the video and the voice previews on the website. </p>
